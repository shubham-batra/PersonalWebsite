This is my personal website. It is accessible at shubham.batra.github.io. I used the Skeleton framework for the quick loading design and good support for a one-page website. HTML and CSS are used extensively. There is some Javascript used for the navigation bar as Skeleton doesn't come with a native navigation bar.

Current Known Issues:
- Naviagtion bar has issues. It is see-through and is layered below text meaning it does not work when over text. On mobile, dropbox does not appear
- Sections have margins that are a bit too long
