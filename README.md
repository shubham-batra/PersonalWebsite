This is my personal website. It is accessible at shubham.batra.github.io. I used the Skeleton framework for the quick loading design and good support for a one-page website. HTML and CSS are used extensively. There is some Javascript used for the navigation bar as Skeleton doesn't come with a native navigation bar.

Current Known Issues:
- Naviagtion bar is see-through and not properly centered
- Sections have margins that are too long
- No version number
