This is my personal website. It is accessible at shubham.batra.github.io

I used the Skeleton framework for the quick loading design and good support for a one-page website.

HTML and CSS are used extensively.

There is some Javascript used for the navigation bar as Skeleton doesn't come with a native navigation bar.
